Write a SQL statement to make a join on the tables salesman, customer and orders in such a form that the same column of each table will appear once and only the relational rows will come
SELECT * FROM orders NATURAL JOIN customer NATURAL JOIN salesman;
SELECT a.COM_NAME, b.PRO_NAME, b.PRO_PRICE FROM company_mast a INNER JOIN item_mast b ON a.COM_ID=b.PRO_COM WHERE PRO_PRICE=(SELECT AVG(PRO_PRICE) FROM b. PRO_PRICE);
