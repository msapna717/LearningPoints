steps:
First of all we need to create a new story(Or we can write test cases for existing story)
Open your story> From “Create New Test” button you can create multiple test-cases for your story
Open your test> Here you can add manual steps, precondition for your test.
Now create test-set> Here you can create/add multiple test cases
Create test plan> Here you can create/add test-cases and test-sets
At the end we have to create test execution by clicking on “Create Test Execution” button on Test plan page
You can create execution “for all tests” or for tests with particular status by selecting “With Status”
Now open your test execution page> From Play button you can execute your test case (You can add comment, defect and screenshot)
You Can see overall test execution status from test execution page
From test plan page you can see the overall test execution status (all executions for that plan)
